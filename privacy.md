## Our approach to cookies

We keep our use of cookies to the bare minimum—just one **strictly necessary** set so the checkout works, and one **optional** set for anonymous usage statistics.

| Category               | Why we use them                                    | When they load |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Strictly necessary** | Enable secure payments and prevent fraud (Stripe)  | Always on      |
| **Optional analytics** | Understand how visitors use the site (GA 4) and Recaptcha Verification to know you are human before submitting the Contact Form | Only after you click **Accept all** |

You can withdraw or change your choice at any time by clicking the cookie settings footer at the bottom of our home page or clear cookies in your browser.

## Strictly necessary: Stripe Buy Button

The Buy Button from Stripe places short-lived cookies to:

* keep track of what you are purchasing as you move through the payment flow;
* detect and prevent fraudulent activity.

Because these cookies are essential for completing a purchase, they cannot be disabled through the banner. If you prefer not to receive them, please do not start the checkout.

| Cookie          | Provider   | Purpose                  | Expiry       |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| `__stripe_mid`  | stripe.com | Device & fraud ID        | 1 year       |
| `__stripe_sid`  | stripe.com | Session identifier       | 30 minutes   |
| `m`             | stripe.com | Mobile device identifier | 2 years      |

*Exact names and lifetimes are controlled by Stripe and may change without notice.*

## Optional analytics: Google Analytics 4

We use Google Analytics (GA) to see which pages are popular so we can improve the site. The data we receive is aggregated and never shows us personal details like your name or precise location.

Analytics cookies are **not** set until you actively choose **Accept all** in the cookie banner.

For more information, please see [Google's Analytics privacy policy](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html).

## Optional analytics: Google reCAPTCHA

We use Google reCAPTCHA to verify that a user is human before submitting forms, such as our contact form. This helps us prevent spam and abuse on the site. reCAPTCHA is **not** activated until you click **Accept all** in the cookie banner.

For more information, please see [Google's reCAPTCHA privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## How to revoke or change consent

1. Click the **Cookie settings** link at the bottom of our home page.  
2. Choose **Allow cookies** or **Reject**.  
3. Refresh the page—your new preference will take effect immediately.

You can also delete cookies manually through your browser settings. Removing cookies does not delete historical analytics reports because those reports contain only aggregated, non-identifiable data.
