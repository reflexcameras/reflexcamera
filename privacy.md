## Our approach to cookies

We keep our use of cookies to the bare minimum—just one **strictly necessary** set so the checkout works, and one **optional** set for anonymous usage statistics.

| Category               | Why we use them                                    | When they load |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Strictly necessary** | Enable secure payments and prevent fraud (Stripe)  | Always on      |
| **Optional analytics** | Understand how visitors use the site (GA 4)        | Only after you click **Accept all** |

You can withdraw or change your choice at any time by clicking the cookie settings footer at the bottom of our home page or clear cookies in your browser.

## Strictly necessary: Stripe Buy Button

The Buy Button from Stripe places short-lived cookies to:

* keep track of what you are purchasing as you move through the payment flow;
* detect and prevent fraudulent activity.

Because these cookies are essential for completing a purchase, they cannot be disabled through the banner. If you prefer not to receive them, please do not start the checkout.

| Cookie          | Provider   | Purpose                  | Expiry       |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| `__stripe_mid`  | stripe.com | Device & fraud ID        | 1 year       |
| `__stripe_sid`  | stripe.com | Session identifier       | 30 minutes   |
| `m`             | stripe.com | Mobile device identifier | 2 years      |

*Exact names and lifetimes are controlled by Stripe and may change without notice.*

## Optional analytics: Google Analytics 4

We use Google Analytics (GA) to see which pages are popular so we can improve the site. The data we receive is aggregated and never shows us personal details like your name or precise location.

Analytics cookies are **not** set until you actively choose **Accept all** in the cookie banner.

| Cookie               | Provider   | Purpose                       | Expiry   | Loads only after consent? |
|----------------------|------------|-------------------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| `_ga`                | google.com | Distinguish unique visitors   | 2 years  | ✅ |
| `_ga_<container-id>` | google.com | Persist session state         | 2 years  | ✅ |
| `_gid`               | google.com | Distinguish visitors for 24 h | 24 hours | ✅ |

We have configured GA to:

* **Anonymise IP addresses** before storage.
* **Retain event data for 14 months**, then automatically delete it.
* **Disable data sharing** with other Google products.

If you click **Reject**, or revoke consent later, these scripts will not run and no analytics cookies will be placed.

## How to revoke or change consent

1. Click the **Cookie settings** link at the bottom of our home page.  
2. Choose **Accept all** or **Reject**.  
3. Refresh the page—your new preference will take effect immediately.

You can also delete cookies manually through your browser settings. Removing cookies does not delete historical analytics reports because those reports contain only aggregated, non-identifiable data.
