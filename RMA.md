# Motion Analysis Service

## Smarter, Faster Bat Footage Analysis

**Reflex Cameras \- Motion Analysis** provides a specialised video processing service designed to significantly reduce the time required to analyse bat infrared (IR) or thermal footage.

Our software extracts a series of jpeg images which represent all movement within each 15 second segment of the processed video \- helping you quickly identify when and where bat activity occurs.

### Reduced workload

Our automated method eliminates the need to manually watch hours of footage. You can go straight to the moments that matter \- the exact sections where bats are recorded \- saving your hours of review time.

### Improved Detection Accuracy

Manual analysis has two major limitations: fatigue and limited focus. As a result, bats emerging or re-entering can easily be missed.

Our processing method reliably identifies and highlights key events such as bat emergence/ re-entry points and flight paths, enabling more accurate assessments than traditional manual review alone.

### You Stay in Control

You, the ecologist, remain in charge of interpreting the results.

Even subtle or hard-to-detect bat movements become visible, while the system’s sensitivity ensures that small objects like moths and insects are also detected and can be filtered as needed.

### Fast Review

Processed outputs are provided as a series of timestamped JPEG images, each summarising detected movement over a 15-second interval.

This format enables rapid review and precise navigation to relevant video sections, substantially reducing analysis time.

One user has reported that it was possible to review footage from 60 emergence surveys in 2 days. 

### Advantages over Cloud-Based Services

Our service runs locally, meaning **no time wasted keeping track and uploading gigabytes of footage to the cloud**.

Uploading large video files can be slow, unreliable, and can even disrupt your internet connection for days. We’ve tested this firsthand and know how impractical it can be when dealing with multiple large files.

Instead, we offer flexible, practical options:

* **Upload smaller batches** of video to Google Drive (works well for smaller projects).  
* **Courier your data** on a backed-up hard drive for large projects \- we’ll cover the return shipping cost for datasets over 10 GB.

### Pricing

**£11 per hour of footage processed**

This method delivers a reliable, efficient, and verifiable approach to bat activity detection — supporting ecologists and consultants in achieving accurate, defensible results with reduced processing time.

### Reviews

For a real world review, do catch up with Tim Rickard or Caleb Fry as they have been using the outputs on Byfleet and SJM and have found several emergences.

### Example Results

The following examples illustrate the type of outputs produced by the Reflex Motion Analysis system. Each sequence of summary images highlights movement detected within the analysed video segments.

#### Example 1: Vegetation and Insect Movement

A tree branch moving on the edge of a building and a moth passing through the field of view.  
This demonstrates the system’s high motion sensitivity and ability to distinguish between environmental movement and potential bat activity.

#### Example 2: Bat Emergence and Flight

A Noctule bat exiting a tree cavity, captured clearly in the processed output.  
The emergence event is distinctly highlighted, allowing rapid verification of bat activity without manual video scrubbing.

#### Example 3: Thermal Camera Detection

Bat emergence recorded using a thermal imaging camera.  
The processing highlights heat signature changes corresponding to flight movement, enabling reliable identification of emergence events.

## How the service works

Contact us via the form on this webpage and provide an estimate of the total size of all video files (in GB). A rough estimate \- such as the total used space occupied by video files on your drive \- is sufficient.

**For small projects** \- Upload your files to **Google Drive** using the link we provide.

**For larger projects** \- **Courier your hard drive** containing a **backed-up copy** of your data to our processing address (details will be provided after submission).

Upon receipt, we will run automated software to retrieve each video duration and compile a summary spreadsheet showing the total hours processed.

We will provide a quote based on the spreadsheet and number of hours of footage on the hard drive. 

If the quote is accepted, we will proceed with the analysis within the agreed timescale (typically **1–2 days**). 

An invoice will be issued following completion of the analysis.

Payment can be made securely via a **Stripe payment link**, which supports **Apple Pay, debit, and credit cards**.

## Instructions

## Image Overview

Each JPEG represents a 15-second segment from a video file. Any motion within that window is overlaid as coloured trails on a black-and-white background. The colours follow a rotation pattern: Red → Green → Blue → Red → Green → Blue, and so on. This helps indicate the direction of movement.

## File Naming

The name of each JPEG file includes the name of the original video file and the start time of the 15-second window it summarises. Note: this timestamp refers to the time within the video, not the actual time of recording.  
Identifying Species:

* Moths often appear as smooth, continuous trails.  
* Bats and birds typically show irregular trails due to wingbeats.  

With practice, you'll start to recognise these patterns more easily.

## Reviewing Video Clips

When you spot a bat-like trail, it's best to review the corresponding 15 seconds of video using VLC Player:  
Enabling motion detection can help but its not always reliable:  
Go to Tools → Effects and Filters → Video Effects, then tick Motion Detect. This will highlight motion with white boxes.  
Use the ‘E’ key to step through frames one by one for detailed inspection.  
Speeding Up Your Workflow:

* Download files locally: Reviewing directly from the server can be slow. Downloading the images and videos to your computer will make loading much faster.  
* Use FastPictureViewer: This program pre-loads images, allowing you to scroll through JPEGs quickly. Just hold down the arrow key to fly through them at speed.

## FAQs

**Has the software been tested, and how accurate is it?**

Yes. The system has been tested in real-world scenarios, including for thermal and infrared recordings. It has been used on emergence and full nights of video as well as crossing point surveys.

It has consistently demonstrated reliable detection of bat movements, including emergence events, re-entries and flight lines.

**If we have multiple projects on the same hard drive, can you split the cost?**

Yes. We can split invoices and payments for different projects stored on the same hard drive.

To ensure this, please save the videos for each project in clearly labelled separate folders, and let us know before analysis begins so we can allocate costs accordingly.

**What resolution should I record in?**

Standard-resolution video is sufficient for accurate analysis — there is no requirement to record in high resolutions like 4K unless you specifically need that level of detail for your own review purposes.

Proper **lighting** and **camera positioning** are far more important factors, as they have a greater influence on the clarity and usefulness of the recorded footage.
