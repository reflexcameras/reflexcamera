#### Battery waterproofing
The following bags have been used to quickly and easily waterproof batteries in the field. Dedicated fully waterproof options are likely to exist but are not included here - reflect on what conditions the battery will be left in.

#### Transporting Batteries
High-capacity batteries can be demanding to transport unaided over long distances. To protect your back, make sure you have suitable equipment for transport. Field-tested options for transport are included in the table below.

#### Solar Panels

Reflex Cameras are designed to run from a 12 V leisure battery, so pairing that battery with a solar panel and charge controller is an easy way to keep the system topped up and extend deployment time indefinitely.

Compatible panels: Any 12 V (nominal) panel - typically 20 W – 100 W depending on how much sun you expect and how many cameras share the battery.
Shade‑friendly: Even under light tree canopy a modern panel will trickle‑charge; you can mount it in a small gap or on a pole that reaches full sun.
Extras you’ll need:
- PWM or MPPT charge controller to protect the battery
- Inline fuse for safety
- Mounts for the panel

#### Mains power - AC
Using a 'Reflex 12V male barrel jack connector' and an AC-to-12V DC plug rated for 5 watts, you can power the system from mains electricity. The 'Reflex 12V male barrel jack connector' plugs directly into a female 2.1mm x 5.5mm barrel AC power supply. Since female 2.1mm x 5.5mm barrel AC power supplies are relatively uncommon, you can alternatively use a male 2.1mm x 5.5mm barrel power supply with a female-to-female adapter. Suitable power supplies are listed in the table below.

| Power Supply                                   | Description                                     | Links                                                                                                     | 2024 Price   |

Barrel jacks do not have locking mechanisms, making them prone to accidental disconnects and water intrusion. For connections in wet environments or those critical to the device's function, a cable junction box offers a more secure and waterproof solution.
